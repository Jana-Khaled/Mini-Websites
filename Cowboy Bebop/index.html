	<p style="font-family: Acme ;">
	Spike Spiegel is a bounty hunter on a spaceship called the Bebop and travels through the space with his crew; <a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Jet_Black">Jet</a> , <a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Faye_Valentine">Faye</a> , <a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Edward">Edward</a> and a dog named Ein. Before becoming a bounty hunter, Spike was a member of the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate. He displayed many talents and abilities, including being skilled in hand-to-hand combat and martial-arts fighting.
	</p>

	<p style="font-family: Acme ;">
		Spike was partnered with <a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Vicious">Viscous</a> in the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate criminal organization, where they earned the reputation as the Syndicate's strongest fighters.
		However, everything changed after Spike fell in love with Viscous' girlfriend <a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Julia">Julia</a>, which resulted in an enemy relationship between Spike and Viscous.
		Through Spike's aims to leave the Syndicate, he struggles to stay with Julia.
		He eventually fakes his death and escapes the Syndicate, however, Julia never arrives to rendezvous with him, instead she goes into hiding to avoid betraying him or being killed herself. 
	</p>

	<p style="font-family: Acme ;">
		Spike eventually met and teamed up with former Inter-Solar System Police (ISSP) officer and bounty hunter Jet Black, the captain of the Bebop. Spike also became a pilot and flied a converted Asteroid racer called the Swordfish II. As legal bounty hunters, Spike and Jet travel the Solar System's inhabited worlds hunting bounty heads across the populated planets and moons of the solar system. They are later joined by Faye Valentine, Edward, and Ein. During his adventures on board the Bebop, Spike confronted various bounty heads and had interactions with other people, including a terrorist, a deranged serial killer, and a bounty hunter styled after an American Western cowboy.

	<h1 id="looks" style="font-family: Bangers; font-size:40px;">Appearance and Personality</h1>
	<img src="10.jfif" height="200px" width="200px">
	<p style="font-family: Acme ;">
		Spike is tall and lean in appearance; he has dark green hair and brown eyes, one of which is later revealed to be artificial and lighter than the other. In a flashback, it's revealed that his right eye was surgically replaced by a fully-functioning cybernetic eye. Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an "accident".

Spike is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III-inspired boots. He also occasionally wears a long brown trench coat. He's often seen with a cigarette between his lips, even if it's raining or there's clearly a 'No Smoking' sign where he is sat, standing, or walking through. Spike's constant smoking is a homage to Lupin III, as Lupin's partner, Jigen, smokes cigarettes that are usually in very poor condition, similar to Spike.
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Acme ;">
		He passes the vast majority of his time on the Bebop lounging, watching TV, or sleeping. On a few rare occasions, he is also seen practicing Jeet Kune Do, a martial arts practice he's very skilled in, being among other things passionate about Bruce Lee and his philosophies (for example, he follows Lee's "water" analogy for his style of fighting). He is a hardened smoker, shown with a cigarette in his mouth in practically every shot (the poor conditions in the cigarettes that are depicted recall those of Daisuke Jigen.) Although he rarely acknowledges it, Spike has very little patience. He repeatedly states he hates dogs, children, and women with attitudes, and is anything but happy when each one of the three joins the Bebop. On the other hand, as the series progressed, he warmed up to Edward, Ein, and Faye, all three of which fall in the category of the three things he particularly hates. He also claims to dislike cats. Spike is rarely seen excited about something and, even less frequently, says he likes something.
		He usually behaves phlegmatically and walks slouching almost as if he is sleepwalking. He appears to be tormented by the ghosts of his past and has frequent nightmares of his life in the Red Dragon. He considers he already died once and therefore doesn't often show fear at the possibility of being killed, often acting as if to challenge death. As stated in a famous clip on his Swordfish II ship saying ¨Whatever happens, happens.¨

One of the recurring themes surrounding Spike's character is how he views himself and his life. Following the implant of an artificial eye, he says his left eye, the real one, sees the past while the synthetic right eye sees the present. This makes the past indelible in his mind, not allowing him to get rid of or forget about it. Despite that, he usually encourages others to forget the past as "not important."

When he is not working, Spike is very laid back, sarcastic, and lively to the dismay of his crewmates. He is typically found either resting on the couch or reading magazines. Spike's philosophy seems to be based on the ancient samurai ideals of immediacy, such as considering oneself as dead and the idea of death as being an awakening from a dream. Both of which are elements of bushido illustrated in the Hagakure.
